                    <div>
                        <p>First things first, a turkey must be selected. Since this is the only day of the year that being a turkey (henceforth known as The Turkey) is advantageous, a contest of knowledge, strength, and overall ~coolness~ will be administered to select The Turkey. Everyone not The Turkey is now a fox (mere common noun fox, suck it) and you can self-organize yourself into teams (henceforth known as skulks cuz it was the coolest collective noun for foxes.)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>After The Turkey is selected and the skulks are set, a similar test of mind, might, and just good-ass vibes will be administered to determine the order in which each skulk can get to skulkin’.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>The Turkey will have a 30 minute head start to select a bar (uhhhh, roost?) from the pre-approved bar list (roost list) and open a tab (ROOST TAB) with the group monies. After the 30 minutes is up, the skulks will get to start their search in the order they were placed at 2 minute intervals. The game is afoot, nerds.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>You MUST choose a roost from the pre-approved list.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You MUST sit at the bar (of the roost.) Not in a hidden booth, not in the bathroom. At the bar.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If the roost you chose has multiple bars, you can choose to sit at either.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You CANNOT move roosts once you’ve picked. That stool pigeon is stuck.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You CANNOT communicate with the skulks. No hints, no misleading hints, no sexts. Turkeys can’t use phones, dummy.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>USE THE RESTROOM before you get set up. Try to hold it until at least one skulk finds you. This will not be enforced cuz that grody but you’re an adult (I hope) so use your best judgement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You CANNOT say you’re playing a game. Give your bartender // friendly roost patron // the demons you carry for eternity // whomever a fun little fib as to why you’re dressed as a turkey.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>NO SHOTS.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>OKAY maybe a shot or two, but try to be respectful of the group. Keep top shelf orders to a minimum, and no buying drinks for those not in the group.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF THE TAB. This means keeping an eye on the amount spent. Everyone else is spending more than you, so any overages are your responsibility. Remember, WE WILL be leaving a 20% tip that will come from the group tab. So the amount we have to spend = TAB / 1.2.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Whenever someone says the word “turkey,” give them your best GOBBLE.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>You MUST stay together with your skulk. Foxes are pack animals (...right? No? These foxes are...) No scouting ahead, no lingering behind.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Skulks CANNOT speak to each other. Y’all all speak different fox dialects or something. No communicating what roosts are clear, what area you’re in, etc. etc.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If your skulk investigates a roost and The Turkey isn’t there, you MUST have one (1) drink per two (2) foxes in your skulk. You a traditional nuclear fox family of 2? Split a beer or flip a coin to see who takes a shot, split a shot, flip a martini into your face, as long as one drink is consumed. You a polyamorous fox lovefest? Same math applies.</p>
                            <p>ONE CAVEAT: We round up, folks. You a skulk of 3? That’s two drinks, sis.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If you attempt to investigate a roost and can see from the outside that The Turkey isn’t there or that another skulk is (more on this…,) HONOR CODE APPLIES. Go in and have the appropriate number of drinks. It is more fun that way (especially since Belltown should be called….Windowtown…. God bless that marketing degree….) </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Each roost can only fit one skulk. If two skulks happen to find themselves in the same roost, they must engage in a good ol’ fashioned TURF WAR.</p>
                            <p>The first skulk to have a fox shout “Too many foxes in this roost!” gets to decide whether…</p>
                            <p><stgrong>The skulk at the roost first must leave. Chug your drinks and skedaddle!</stgrong></p>
                            <h3>Or</h3>
                            <p><stgrong>The skulk that just entered must leave. Enjoy your free pass and keep searching!</stgrong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Once your skulk finds The Turkey, you can KILL AND EAT THEIR FLESH, IT IS YOUR JUST REWARD or you can start drinking off the shared tab, your call.</p>
