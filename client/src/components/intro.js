                    <p>No, not that Turkey Day. The better one. The one that involves excessive drinking, avoiding those you hold dear, and a fully stuffed turkey.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Ahh shit. I guess that didnâ€™t help clarify. How about this: the one where you make a fool of yourself trying to find some inebriated jagweed, costumed in fowlish garbs resplendent? Yeah, thatâ€™s better.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to the Turkey Trot aka Turkey Hunt aka Turducken-in-that-bar-over-there aka This Is Why I Majored In Marketing?ðŸ¦ƒðŸ¦ƒðŸ¦ƒðŸ¦ƒâ„¢â€¦. In this inaugural installation of a familiar bar crawl, we will be teaming up to scour the streets of Belltown in search of the worldâ€™s best drawn bird. Drinks will be drunk, chuckles will be chuckled, and weâ€™ll greatly inflate the tip jar of one lucky sumbitch, in the true GIVING spirit (while taking spirits.)</p>

                <div>
                    <p>We (Dumb Marketing Boy and Even Dumber Website Boy) are excited to have you onboard for this wonderful occasion, and let us be the first to wish you Happy Hunting!</p>

                    <p>A can drink attitude!</p>
                    <p>$25 Venmo to @danheyward before Thursday - We thought a pre-paid visa would be easier for the bar</p>
                    <p>Some good vibes</p>
